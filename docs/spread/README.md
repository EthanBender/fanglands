# The Great Spread: artefacts

The staged build spec lives outside the repo (`~/.fanglands/work/spread/spec.md`). This folder holds what its tools
make and read. Nothing here is loaded by the game.

| File | Made by | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `baseline-fingerprint.json` | `node tools/fingerprint.mjs index.html --out docs/spread/baseline-fingerprint.json --from "master <sha>"` | The fingerprint of master at the start of the stage: one hash per table in plain sight, and the tables themselves gzipped (for `--diff`'s entry lists). Regenerated after every peer merge, before any conversion goes on top of it. |
| `inventory.json` | `node tools/literals.mjs --inventory` | Every bare coordinate-shaped literal in src/, with file, line, column, the literal and its guessed anchor. |
| `converted.json` | by hand, one file per Stage 1-3 commit | The files the build's literals gate checks. Empty until Stage 1. |
| `literals-allow.json` | by hand | Literals the gate lets through (instance-local and UI numbers), each with a reason. |
| `strict-allow.json` | by hand (Stage 1 on) | Frame points the strict report may log (relative geometry, such as the rim notch), each with a reason. |

## Proving "nothing visible changed" (spec §9.4)

```
./build.sh
node tools/fingerprint.mjs index.html --diff docs/spread/baseline-fingerprint.json   # exit 0: identical
git diff --exit-code online/src/atlas.json                                           # byte-identical
```

## The fingerprint is sensitive (Stage 0 proof, 3 Oct 2026, baseline master e24001a)

One literal changed at a time in a scratch copy of src/ (never committed), built, and diffed against the baseline:

| File | Literal changed | `--diff` names |
|---|---|---|
| 02-world (a building) | house `h2` x 88 -> 89 | `map`, `buildings`, `capital`, `atlas` (first entries: tile 88,26 16 -> 0 ...) |
| 13-ux (a map target) | `MAP_TARGETS[7]` x 152 -> 153 | `map_targets` ([7] 152,30 -> 153,30), `map_hooks` (stage 7, main) |
| 29-quests (a quest position) | the cave notice board `BOARD_TILES[1]` 24,6 -> 24,5 | `map` (tile 24,5 0 -> 106; tile 24,6 106 -> 6) |
| 92-worldshape (an outline point) | the Goblin Fields' bay `!near(x, y, 66, 57, 13, 7)` -> 67 | `map`, `worldshape`, `atlas` (tiles 32,59 ...) |

Notes on the proof:
- 29-quests places no NPC of its own (its people are 02-world's, by id); the notice board's tile is the position it
  owns, so that is the literal moved.
- A first try at 92 moved the Goblin Fields' east headland `near(x, y, 150, 52, 10, 8)` by one tile and the fingerprint
  did not change: that lobe lies wholly inside the region's own noise band, so the outline it ORs in was already there.
  Moving a literal that changes nothing on screen is, rightly, not a visible change.
